    steps:
      - name: Set up Python

        run: python email_report.py
 
 The workflow file is named  deploy-app.yml  and is located in the  .github/workflows  directory. The workflow is triggered by a schedule event at 6 a.m. daily. The job runs on an Ubuntu runner and has three steps: 
 
 Set up Python 
 Install dependencies 
 Email report 
 
 The Email report step uses environment variables to access SMTP server details and email account credentials. The Python script  email_report.py  sends a report from a file to the specified email address. 
 The SMTP server details and email account credentials are stored as secrets in the GitHub repository. 
 Conclusion 
 This article discussed how to send an email using Python. We covered the Python smtplib library, which provides an SMTP client for sending emails. We also discussed how to send an email with an attachment, HTML content, and multiple recipients. 
 To send emails with Python, you need to have access to an SMTP server. You can use a public SMTP server or set up your own SMTP server. 
 We also discussed how to send an email using the GitHub Actions workflow. We created a GitHub Actions workflow that sends an email with a report from a file at 6 a.m. daily. 
 To learn more about sending emails with Python, check out the  smtplib documentation.
